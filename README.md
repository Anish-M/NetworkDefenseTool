Introduction and Statement of Purpose
My final product will be a network protection program that utilizes a
Raspberry Pi to run an intrusion detection system. I want to create this product to
monitor a network and be able to see the metrics of attacks such as type of
attack, number of packets, the location of the attack and more. The IDS should be
able to perform a few actions such as alerting, logging or blocking the packets
based on type of the intrusion. My overall end goal with the network defense
mechanism is to configure, and host tools on a Raspberry Pi that can keep a
network safe from hackers through the identification of hacking attempt metrics.
The successful completion of my final product can be a useful asset to home,
school, and business networks.
The purpose of my product is to understand the kinds of threats that a
network is exposed to and find ways to better observe and secure the landscape
of a network. It will also be used as an economical and effective way to protect a
home network. This product will require me to learn more about how to use the
Raspberry Pi and linux programming. I also want to be able to display all my
results on the terminal that can easily be interpreted by the general public and
without a technical background. I want my product to extensively reflect my
knowledge about cybersecurity and my product deals with a different area of
cybersecurity than my original work.

Review of Skills and Research
The product idea I have chosen will require me to research the capabilities
of the raspberry pi, how a honeypot works, how a intrusion detection system
works, and further get very conversant with the Linux operating system. I can
acquire this knowledge through online research and videos. In addition to that, I
will work with my mentor to learn about other security devices and applications
in a variety of environments such as home network or a corporate network. I also
need to research which IDS is suitable and adaptable to my environment and
setup. The main component of this product would be to understand the
configuration and operation of an IDS. The other parts of the product which I
need to research are how to open up ports to create a vulnerable system(also
called honeypot). Also, I will need to install an attacker mechanism to simulate
attacks towards the honeypot. To make the setup simpler, I need to learn how to

install multiple machines on a single computer using a virtual machine. I will also
need to understand the architecture of my network and see how I can apply my
product to my home network.
The product requires both a vast knowledge base and skill set in order to
complete and working on this product will expose me to a variety of concepts that
are important to know in the cybersecurity world. I can adapt my product to have
a better real world application by consulting with my mentor. My mentor has
worked with numerous applications and it is important to guide my product
towards a bigger goal that can solve a problem.

Methodology
In order to bring my product to completion, I will first research the type of
raspberry pi I should get and how I can set up and IDS on it. After researching, I
will gather all my materials as outlined below. Once ready, I can set up the
raspberry pi computer with Linux installed on it. After this, I will configure a
honeypot on a seperate linux operating system. After further research, I will
include an IDS on the pi. After proper configuration, I will set up the raspberry pi
to work with my home network. Once everything is properly set up, I will then run
some attacks on the honeypot such as brute forcing a common port for
authentication, etc. and see if the honeypot is able to collect any results. If the
results are successful and all the attack metrics can be measured, I will see what
data I am able to observe. I want to see other potential applications of the
product and find ways that I can use a honeypot to not only record attacks but
also deflect them.
Materials
For my final product, I will need a raspberry pi 4B, a monitor, a computer, and
access to a network (such as my own home network). The raspberry pi device
costs about $35.00-$45.00 and I have all other materials required like
keyboard, mouse, cables for this project. The materials for this project arenâ€™t
very demanding because of the technicality required for my product. The total
cost should be, at most, $50.00.
Conclusions
The outcome of my product will allow me to see the scale of attacks that
can occur over a network and how attacks are performed. My product will allow
users and network admins to see the type of threats that are occurring on a

network and allow them to protect their networks from attacks. By seeing this
information, people will be able to customize their security architecture to better
block out attacks and mitigate the risks that come with an exposed network. My
product will help me understand many different concepts in cybersecurity and
has the possibility to be a useful asset to large organizations. I am very excited to
pursue this project since there are many different skills I will need to utilize to
complete this project. While I originally will use my product with my home
network, I hope to try it on other networks to ensure its success and prove its
ability to have an impact in the community.
